On 10-11-2020, DIVD researchers began scanning for vulnerabilities of a total of 313,000 domain names containing WordPress content management systems. This list was received by DIVD from infooNL.

Eventually 2 major vulnerabilities were found:
- Publicly readable dump.sql files
- Duplicator plugin installer-log.txt

On 25-11-2020, DIVD researchers have sent notifications by email to owners with Publicly Readable dump.sql files in their Wordpress configuration. A total of 17 notifications were sent. 2 notifications were returned.

On 30-11-2020, DIVD researchers have sent notifications by email to owners with Duplicator plugin installer-log.txt files in their Wordpress configuration. A total of 85 notifications were sent. 2 notifications were returned.

After the notifications were sent and because there were no further questions, it was decided to close this case. Still, we will be using the list of domain names for future research on WordPress vulnerabilities.
