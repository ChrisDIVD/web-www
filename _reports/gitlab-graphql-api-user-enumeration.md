excerpt: Several vulnerabilities found in Gitlab
published: false

---
On November 18, 2021, a researcher at security company Rapid7 discovered a vulnerability (CVE-2021-4191) in Gitlab, that gave an unauthorized user the opportunity to collect the personal information of other users. GitLab is open-source DevOps software. The vulnerability could give a remote, unauthenticated attacker the possibility to collect registered GitLab usernames, names, and email addresses. Malicious actors could use this information to conduct brute-force attacks, including password guessing, password spraying - trying usernames with common passwords â€“ and credential stuffing - algorithmically trying usernames and passwords on different sites. The vulnerability affected GitLab versions since 13.0.

Following responsible disclosure, on February 25, 2022, GitLab published a fix for the vulnerability. DIVD scanned the internet and found almost 14000 vulnerable systems. The DIVD notified the system onwers and advised them to update to version 14.6.5, 14.7.4 or 14.8.2. Besides CVE-2021-4191 the patch also fixes six other security flaws, one of which is critical (CVE-2022-0735) .

Disabling public profiles would also prevent against unauthenticated information gathering.

On July 1 still 6415 systems were vulnerable and a notification was sent.

After a final scan on Augus 31t there were still 5447 vulnerable systems left, but the case was closed.
