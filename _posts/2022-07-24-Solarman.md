The inverters of nearly a million solar panels world wide have been highly vulnerable to cyber attacks due to poorly secured back-end systems in China. At least 42,000 of these solar panels are based in the Netherlands. Hackers of the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure found out about this vulnerability and published their research about this today. The hackers were able to access the management panel of the Chinese company Solarman via super admin credentials previously leaked onto GitHub. Solarman is a Chinese company which manages solar panels, inverters and batteries.

Solarman is a supplier of equipment and has a platform that monitors energy generated and delivered back to the grid for consumer owned solar panels. DIVD hackers were able to view lists of thousands of names and addresses via the super admin account. In theory, they could create or delete customer accounts and view all data including the amount of power generated, whether the panels were connected to the internet, and whether there were any faults in the system.

A cybercriminal with access to this administrator account could, in theory, upload new firmware to these inverters and turn it into a huge botnet with potentially disastrous consequences for the global electricity grid. Switching large numbers of inverters off and on again quickly at tactical times would be a blow to the electricity grid.

DIVD has contacted Solarman in various ways to report these findings and to convince the company that their systems are vulnerable, but there has been no response. Ultimately, at the request of DIVD, the Dutch Embassy in China took action to establish contact between the Dutch and Solarman. The Chinese CERT, CN-CERT also played a positive crucial role in these events. The login details have subsequently been changed.This investigation took place last year and was made public today during the hacker camp “MCH2022” in the Dutch town of Zeewolde.
