Hello reader, 

My name is Erkan Sirmasiz and I am 28 years old and living in The Netherlands.  I try everyday to be a succes enthusiastic hacker and my final is to mean something for the hacker community/cyber security.

My mentality is solution-oriented and I believe I can be a part to make a different in the hacking world and the cyber security. Maybe we have to think different then we all do. 

Curious about my path?

Youtube channel: Hacker2Talk

My purpose in the scenes of the Cyber Security and Hacking world is to help others and make the impossible, possible.
